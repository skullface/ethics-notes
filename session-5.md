# 3 Mar: Algorithmic decision-making and accountability

> ### Topics
> - Use of predictive algorithms in public vs. private settings, with emphasis on the criminal justice system
> - Comparative approaches to algorithmic transparency and accountability (e.g., auditing, technological due process)
> - Trade-offs between predictive accuracy and competing values (e.g., fairness, transparency, explainability)
>
