## Lecture notes

Technology's effect on labor is not new. 

How can we think systematically about the effects of automation on wages, employment, and economic growth? Acemoglu and Restrepo offer an economic framework for assessing the impact of automation:

1. A **displacement effect** whereby AI and robotics replace workers in tasks they previously performed
2. A **productivity effect** as the cost of production declines
3. **Capital accumpulation** triggered by increased automation will increase the demand for labor
4. **Deepening of automation** as productivity increases further in already-automated tasks
5. A **reinstatement effect** in which **new tasks** increase the demand for labor

While we don’t have estimates of automation’s impact on social dynamics, there is growing literature on the political and social impacts of job losses from off-shoring labor:

* [Feigenbaum and Hall (2015)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/682151?seq=1) find that job losses drive politicians to adopt much more protectionist positions in Congress
* [Ballard-Rosa, et al (2018)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0aHygT4AAAAJ&hl=en#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3D0aHygT4AAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3D0aHygT4AAAAJ%3ASe3iqnhoufwC%26tzom%3D300) find that job losses drive the adoption of more “authoritarian values” and support for anti-establishment parties (in both the US and UK)

How might automation-induced job losses affect political behavior and attitudes?

We must address AI and automation’s potential to increase inequality.

Oxford researchers posit 47% of jobs are at a high risk of being lost to automation by 2030 while the international Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development only estimates 9%. ([Grayline](https://graylinegroup.com/robotics-and-labor-scarcity/))
