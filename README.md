# Ethics, Public Policy and Technology Change course notes

I’m taking a class and keeping my lecture and discussion notes here!

---

## Session 1 of 7, 3 Feb

As a group of technology professionals who care about ethics, we are not trying to find a utopia that can’t exist — but not having a perfect answer to our thorny problems is not an excuse to throw up our hands and do nothing. “**_Complicity is the resting state of adulthood._**” Learning, thinking, and engaging in discussions about ethics should be morally ”caffeinating“, stimulating for future action.

### Reading discussion

* Le Guin, Ursula K. “[The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas).” 1973.

We approach this not from a utilitarian context (i.e., the trolley problem, *The Good Place*) as it is traditionally considered, but within the context of our industry. Are “the ones who walk away from Omelas” heroes or cowards? Are those who stay and advocate for better “activists”? What about choosing the dictitatorial path to free the child yourself? Can anyone actually walk away? What are we walking away from?

Consider rejecting the premise of the question before even considering your answer to the question.

You should lose sleep at night when you hesitate between answering what you *should* do and what you *would* do.
