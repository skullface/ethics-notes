  <summary>Course description</summary>

> **Evening course with Stanford professors and Bloomberg Beta (Feb–March 2021)**
>
> Over the course of seven weeks, admitted students will study with three Stanford professors and a curated group of technologists, public officials, civil society leaders, and scholars in conversation around ethics, public policy, and technological change.
>
> The focus: discuss multiple, often opposing, views about what can and should be done around the ethical and social issues technology companies face. We’ll look at fundamental texts, and explore them in the context of issues like; obligations to community and society, data privacy, algorithmic decision-making, handling contractors vs. employees, geopolitics, the power of private platforms, diversity and inclusion, and the culture of Silicon Valley.

## 3 Feb: Opening session

As a group of technology professionals who care about ethics, we are not trying to find a utopia that can’t exist — but not having a perfect answer to our thorny problems is not an excuse to throw up our hands and do nothing. “**_Complicity is the resting state of adulthood._**” Learning, thinking, and engaging in discussions about ethics should be morally ”caffeinating“, stimulating for future action.

### Reading discussion

- Le Guin, Ursula K. “[The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas).” 1973.

We approach this not from a utilitarian context (i.e., the trolley problem, _The Good Place_) as it is traditionally considered, but within the context of our industry. Are “the ones who walk away from Omelas” heroes or cowards? Are those who stay and advocate for better “activists”? What about choosing the dictitatorial path to free the child yourself? Can anyone actually walk away? What are we walking away from?

Consider rejecting the premise of the question before even considering your answer to the question.

You should lose sleep at night when you hesitate between answering what you _should_ do and what you _would_ do.

## 10 Feb: Data collection, privacy and digital civil liberties

### Focuses
- Changing norms and laws around privacy across time and cultures, including how people balance privacy vs. other goals
- Data aggregation, matching, and de-anonymization strategies
- Facial recognition technology (used by public and private actors)
- Consent for different types and uses of data

### What is privacy?

- Aristotle: public sphere (politics and commerce 🚹) differs from private sphere (domestic life, family and friends 🚺)
  - Individuals have interests in shielding the public from what happens in private

- Social context is key, regardless of being in public or private
  - We want to be able to control what is known about us + how we present ourselves
  - Privacy is central to individual autonomy or self-determination

- Modern, philosophical defintion of privacy:
  > **The claim of individuals to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is shared with or communicated to others**\
  > _Privacy and Freedom_, by Alan F. Westin, Atheneum, 1970, p. 7. 
  - Violations of privacy impose harms
  - Privacy is about protecting intimacy, freedom, and control (Solove, “‘I’ve Got Nothing to Hide’”)

#### Privacy harms
Solove, Daniel J. “[A Taxonomy of Privacy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40041279?seq=1).” University of Pennsylvania Law Review, vol. 154, no. 3, 2006, p. 477.

1. Information collection (surveillance)
2. Information processing (aggregation and inferences from big data)
3. Information dissemination (breach of confidentialty, discloure third parties, blackmail)
4. Invasion of privacy (intrusion, decision interference)

#### Rival values

What other values/rights/interests might be in tension with privacy?

1. National security (terrorism)
2. Public safety (crime)
3. Innovation
4. Convenience

#### Notice and consent

- U.S. approach to a company’s data: transparency and choice 
- U.S. entities inform individuals and provide a choice to consent or not
- …This is appealing because 
  1. our idea of privacy is to control information about ourselves
  2. we are committed to the idea of a free market
- But that’s only true if…
  1. Individuals must be able to make informed, rational choices about the costs and benefits of different privacy policies
  2. The market must be able to deliver a diversity of products with different privacy settings
  3. We must be able to achive the societal balance that we want between privacy and other values via a set of decentralized decisions
- …Are those true in practice?
- Are individuals today actually up to the challenge of navigating privacy?
  - Social scientists are skeptical (Acquisti 2015). Lawyers are concerned (Solove 2013). Information scientists doubt it (Nissenbaum 2011).
    1. People are uncertain about their preferences
    2. Pereferences are context-dependent
    3. Privacy prefs can be manipulated
    4. Privacy self-management does not scale well
    5. People cannot factor in aggregation
    6. People cannot anticipate harm

#### What are the alternatives?

- Comprehensive privacy regulation
  - …denies people the freedom to make choices
  - …is not always clear in the trade off of privacy vs. data use
  - …limits social benefits to data aggregation
- Improving privacy self-management through:
  - Opt-in > opt-out consent
  - Global > local management
  - Focus on downstream use
  - Acceptability of basic privacy norms

#### Perspectives on data privacy

- Data privacy often involves a balance of competing interests
- Making data available for meaningful analysis
  - for public good: medical research and healthcare improvement, protecting national security
  - for private good: personalized advertising
- Deleting identifiers doesn’t make PII unidentifiable

### Why do _I_ care about protecting my own privacy?

- I’m an outspoken woman on the Internet and that comes with a cost. I need to protect myself and my family from any potential abuse.
- I don’t want to be discriminated against based on criteria I don’t know about. 
- I’m going to live for a while — I want to be in charge of what information about me exists in the future for myself and my family.
- I want to be able to protest against my country and my government without fear for my safety.
- I don’t want to be treated differently because of lifestyle choices I intend to keep private.
- I want to be able to make my own decisions without the influence of microtargeting.
- I work for a visible, prominent company, and bad actors could weaponize that against me based on information I intend to keep private.

## 17 Feb: Platforms and the public sphere

### Content moderation

Content moderation is a really hard problem.
 * Obvious to us in tech, but not to ordinary citizens
 * What makes speech valuable? What about technology that changes that? 
 * The rise of private superpowers not beholden to the first amendment: Facebook and Twitter’s policies on expression is more consequential than France's. 
 * Autonomous review and 
 * There are more options than a binary show/don't show when it comes to content moderation
    * Subject content to fact-checking, warning messages, lower its reach through visibility filtering, user timeouts, etc.
    * Whether content _exists_ is different from whether content is seen

Salesforce has [taken unspecified action to stop the RNC](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225936/salesforce-stop-rnc-sending-emails-incite-violence) from sending messages from possibly inciting violence. How far up the stack or down the stack should content moderation go? Telecom companies? Telecom companies _are_ already supposed to be content moderators with regard to spam and robocalls…

”Awful but lawful” must be codified as “lawful” is a very low bar with regard to content moderation.

There is an unprecedented level of scope to community standards on social media.

When you can't define the science behind the “art” of moderation, how do you move forward? 

#### De-platforming, banning, suspending

We’ve seen three approaches to platform restrictions:
- Banning an individual from a platform (e.g., Trump banned from Twitter, FB)
- Removing an app from the App Store or Google Play Store (e.g., Parler app removed from both stores)
- Suspending hosting for an app/social network (e.g., AWS cutting Parler’s cloud hosting)

…Are these approaches equally valid? If not, why not?

Deplatforming Parler was a deplatforming of a platform. Apple asked Parler to provide a [content moderation plan within 24 hours](https://mashable.com/article/tim-cook-apple-parler-suspension-app-store-moderation/) before kicking them off. Will Apple ask that of others? Is Apple now a content moderation reviewer?

Should we think of AWS as similar to or different than the major social media platforms with respect to the power/right they should have to deny access to their services?

How should the app store or cloud service provider determine whether or not to allow an app? Should it be based on the app’s stated Terms of Service or how the app is actually being used?

International human rights standards on incitement differ from existing content moderation policies… and international human rights standards value freedom of expression.

Will fringe audiences radicalize further as the large forum public spaces online disallow their conversation?

In a polarized society, people will look to the individuals with the most power and influence and thus the greatest ability to cause harm and further division.

#### Government actors

Is it justifiable for a platform to handle accounts of public officials differently than those of the general public? Should this policy be different in democracies than it is in non-democracies? How so?
- Political officials that have an incentive to stay in power despite not being democratically elected should be held to the same standard citizens are, without special treatment (fact checking, rule breaking, etc.)

### [Facebook’s Oversight Board](https://oversightboard.com/)
Should Twitter join Facebook’s review board? Mark shouldn’t decide things alone, and neither should [Jack](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510769268850690). 

Does a review board remove accountability from the company itself? Is that a good thing? The review board has a different incentive structure than business needs. The review board is an Appeal Court, not a Decision Body. Is public transparency in the board — its members, its budget, its process — even more important than what the board _does_?

What are decisions that courts should make vs. decisions that companies should make?

Historically, decisions and documents in major decisions are internal, which means there is a lack of public transparency and oversight.
