### Course description

> **Evening course with Stanford professors and Bloomberg Beta (Feb–March 2021)**
>
> Over the course of seven weeks, admitted students will study with three Stanford professors and a curated group of technologists, public officials, civil society leaders, and scholars in conversation around ethics, public policy, and technological change.
>
> The focus: discuss multiple, often opposing, views about what can and should be done around the ethical and social issues technology companies face. We’ll look at fundamental texts, and explore them in the context of issues like; obligations to community and society, data privacy, algorithmic decision-making, handling contractors vs. employees, geopolitics, the power of private platforms, diversity and inclusion, and the culture of Silicon Valley.
