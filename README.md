# “Ethics, Public Policy and Technology Change” course notes

> **“If we want a more ethically informed technology industry today, we need an ethical study for technology professionals, not just college students.”** — Lisa Wehden, [Silicon Valley Needs a New Approach to Studying Ethics Now More than Ever](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/silicon-valley-needs-a-new-approach-to-studying-ethics-now-more-than-ever/)

Collected notes, links, and musings from the 2-month evening course on ethics in technology for working professionals, from Stanford and Bloomberg Beta.

From the course sign-up:
> **Evening course with Stanford professors and Bloomberg Beta (Feb–March 2021)**
>
> Over the course of seven weeks, admitted students will study with three Stanford professors and a curated group of technologists, public officials, civil society leaders, and scholars in conversation around ethics, public policy, and technological change.
>
> The focus: discuss multiple, often opposing, views about what can and should be done around the ethical and social issues technology companies face. We’ll look at fundamental texts, and explore them in the context of issues like; obligations to community and society, data privacy, algorithmic decision-making, handling contractors vs. employees, geopolitics, the power of private platforms, diversity and inclusion, and the culture of Silicon Valley.

## Session 1, 3 Feb

As a group of technology professionals who care about ethics, we are not trying to find a utopia that can’t exist — but not having a perfect answer to our thorny problems is not an excuse to throw up our hands and do nothing. “**_Complicity is the resting state of adulthood._**” Learning, thinking, and engaging in discussions about ethics should be morally ”caffeinating“, stimulating for future action.

### Reading discussion

* Le Guin, Ursula K. “[The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas).” 1973.

We approach this not from a utilitarian context (i.e., the trolley problem, *The Good Place*) as it is traditionally considered, but within the context of our industry. Are “the ones who walk away from Omelas” heroes or cowards? Are those who stay and advocate for better “activists”? What about choosing the dictitatorial path to free the child yourself? Can anyone actually walk away? What are we walking away from?

Consider rejecting the premise of the question before even considering your answer to the question.

You should lose sleep at night when you hesitate between answering what you *should* do and what you *would* do.
